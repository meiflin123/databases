# databases
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

### Requirements
You'll be working with SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with a MySQL database. MySQL is a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) that is incredibly popular and utilizes SQL.
You've already learned to store data for your server-side applications "in-memory" using JavaScript variables and by writing text files to disk. In this sprint, after learning to use SQL to define table schemas and write queries you're going to create a MySQL database to persist data for your chatterbox-server(an app previously built). Persistence you'll recall is the ability to remember data even after the server is restarted, and most applications require it.
